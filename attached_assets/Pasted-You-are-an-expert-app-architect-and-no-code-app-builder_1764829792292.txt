You are an expert app architect and no-code app builder.

I want you to design and build a simple, production-ready app for a small local lunch bar that is always busy at their sandwich/wrap bar.

The goal of the app:
- Let customers order their sandwich/wrap/salad online BEFORE they arrive.
- Let them pay online.
- Let staff see incoming orders on an iPad at the sandwich station in a very clear, visual way.
- Let staff update order status easily (e.g. “New”, “In Progress”, “Ready”, “Out of stock – needs reply”).
- Let staff quickly toggle ingredients in and out of stock so customers cannot order things that are unavailable.
- Make it very fast and simple for the staff to use in the middle of a busy lunch rush.

Please read ALL requirements below first, then:
1) Restate your understanding of the app.
2) Propose the data structure (tables, fields, relationships).
3) Propose the main screens and flows.
4) THEN generate the app based on your proposal.

If any part is not technically possible in this environment, explain the limitation clearly and suggest the closest alternative instead of refusing.

------------------------------------------------
PART 1 – APP USERS & ROLES
------------------------------------------------

There are two main types of users:

1. CUSTOMER
- Can browse the menu (based on a paper order form the shop already uses).
- Can build their order (e.g. choose wrap/sandwich/salad, bread type, fillings, salads, extras, sauce, etc.).
- Can choose a preferred pickup time (within the shop’s open hours).
- Can see an order summary and pay online.
- Can see their order status:
  - NEW / RECEIVED
  - IN PROGRESS / BEING MADE
  - READY FOR PICKUP
  - ISSUE – PLEASE CHECK MESSAGE (e.g. ingredient out of stock)
- Should be notified when the order is marked READY.
  - If push notifications are not possible, use in-app status with a refresh button and optionally email/SMS if supported by this platform.

2. STAFF / ADMIN (SANDWICH STATION)
- Use an iPad at the sandwich bar.
- See a live queue of orders as they come in (sorted by pickup time and order time).
- Each order tile should clearly show:
  - Customer name
  - Pickup time
  - Order items (with ingredients clearly listed)
  - Special instructions
  - Payment status (paid/unpaid)
- Staff should be able to:
  - Tap an order and mark status: “Start / In Progress” → “Ready” → “Completed”.
  - Tap a simple button to mark an ingredient “Out of stock”.
  - When an ingredient is out of stock and an order contains it:
    - The system should flag the order.
    - Staff can send a quick pre-written message to the customer: for example,
      “We’ve just run out of [INGREDIENT]. Would you like to replace it with [ALT_INGREDIENT] or remove it?”
    - Customer can confirm/change via a simple yes/no or quick choice if this platform allows; otherwise we just show a note that staff will confirm verbally at pickup.

- Admin (owner/manager) should also have access to:
  - Manage menu items and prices.
  - Manage ingredient stock toggles (in stock / out of stock).
  - View basic order history.

------------------------------------------------
PART 2 – MENU & ORDER FORM
------------------------------------------------

The lunch bar already has a printed order form at the counter that customers fill out. I want the digital ordering screen to mirror that form as closely as possible.

Please create a flexible menu structure based on typical sandwich bar sections such as:

- Base type:
  - Wrap
  - Sandwich
  - Roll
  - Salad bowl
- Bread/wrap options:
  - e.g. White, Wholemeal, Multigrain, Gluten-free wrap, etc.
- Standard fillings:
  - e.g. Ham, Chicken, Turkey, Tuna, Egg, Falafel, etc. (these should be configurable).
- Salad options (multi-select):
  - e.g. Lettuce, Tomato, Cucumber, Carrot, Onion, Cheese, etc.
- Extras / add-ons:
  - e.g. Avocado, Extra meat, Extra cheese, Bacon, etc. with extra cost.
- Sauces:
  - e.g. Mayo, Sweet chilli, BBQ, etc.
- Toasted or not.
- Any special notes field.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Build the menu system so that:
  - New products and categories can be added in the future (e.g. hot food, coffee).
  - Each ingredient can be toggled “in stock” / “out of stock”.
  - If an item is out of stock, it should not be selectable for new customer orders.
  - If an item goes out of stock AFTER an order is placed, staff can flag that order as “Issue – Out of stock” and send a pre-written message.

If possible, design the menu configuration so that:
- Admin can configure:
  - Name
  - Category (base/filling/salad/extra/sauce)
  - Price
  - In-stock flag (True/False)

------------------------------------------------
PART 3 – ORDER FLOW (CUSTOMER SIDE)
------------------------------------------------

The typical online customer flow should be:

1. HOME SCREEN
   - Simple landing screen with:
     - Lunch bar name and logo (placeholder for now).
     - Button: “Order Now”.
     - Display today’s opening hours and current order cut-off times if possible.

2. ORDER BUILDER
   - Step 1: Choose base (wrap, sandwich, roll, salad, etc.).
   - Step 2: Choose bread/wrap type.
   - Step 3: Choose filling(s).
   - Step 4: Choose salad toppings (multi-select).
   - Step 5: Choose extras/add-ons (with extra prices shown).
   - Step 6: Choose sauce(s).
   - Step 7: Toasted or not.
   - Step 8: Add special instructions.
   - Step 9: Choose pickup time:
     - Must be within store open hours.
     - Default to “ASAP” with an estimated prep time (e.g. 10–20 mins) if supported.

3. CART & CHECKOUT
   - Show order summary (items, ingredients, total price).
   - Allow customer to add multiple items (e.g. 2 wraps, 1 salad).
   - Allow them to enter:
     - Name
     - Phone number
     - Optional email
   - Require payment online (if payment is not supported, simulate “paid” status and treat it as “pay on pickup” – but design as if online payment is possible).

4. ORDER CONFIRMATION
   - Show order number and pickup time.
   - Show order status as “Received”.
   - Provide a “View order status” screen where they can see updates:
     - “Received”
     - “In progress”
     - “Ready for pickup”
     - “Issue – please see counter” (if needed).

------------------------------------------------
PART 4 – SANDWICH STATION iPAD VIEW (STAFF SIDE)
------------------------------------------------

This is critical. The iPad view must be:

- Simple
- Big and visual
- Easy to tap with messy hands during rush hour

Requirements:

1. MAIN QUEUE SCREEN
   - Display orders in a scrollable list or tile grid.
   - Each order tile should show:
     - Order number
     - Customer name
     - Pickup time
     - Time since order received
     - High-level summary (e.g. “Chicken wrap, salad bowl”)
     - Current status (colour coded: NEW, IN PROGRESS, READY, ISSUE).
   - Allow sorting by:
     - Pickup time (default)
     - Time since received.

   - When a new order arrives:
     - Visually highlight it (e.g. border, blink) and optionally play a subtle sound if possible.

2. ORDER DETAIL VIEW
   - When staff tap an order tile, they see:
     - Full breakdown of each item and ingredients in a clean layout.
     - Special instructions.
     - Payment status.
   - Buttons:
     - “Mark as In Progress”
     - “Mark as Ready”
     - “Mark as Completed”
     - “Flag as Issue – Out of Stock”
   - If “Flag as Issue – Out of Stock” is used:
     - Allow staff to tick which ingredient is out of stock.
     - Generate a simple message template to the customer (if messaging is supported) or at least flag the order with a big warning for pick-up.

3. ORDER STATUS UPDATE
   - When an order is:
     - Marked “In Progress”: update in customer view.
     - Marked “Ready”: update in customer view and trigger notification (if possible).
   - Completed orders should move to a separate “Completed” list so the main queue only shows active orders.

4. STOCK TOGGLE SECTION
   - On the iPad, add a simple “Stock” tab or side panel:

   - Show a list of key ingredients/choices with a simple toggle:
     - In Stock / Out of Stock
   - Changes should:
     - Immediately prevent new orders from selecting that ingredient.
     - Visually display “OUT OF STOCK” next to that ingredient in any menus.
   - For simplicity, we can start with:
     - Bread/wrap types
     - Popular proteins/fillings
     - Popular extras (like avocado).

------------------------------------------------
PART 5 – DATA MODEL (PLEASE DESIGN)
------------------------------------------------

Please propose a clean, normalised data model that supports all of this. At a minimum, include entities such as:

- Customer
- Order
- OrderItem
- MenuCategory
- MenuItem
- MenuOption / Ingredient
- IngredientStock (or a simple in_stock boolean on MenuItem/Ingredient)
- StaffUser (optional, can also have a generic “Staff” role)
- OpeningHours (optional, but ideal for future)

For each entity, list:
- Field name
- Data type
- Example value
- Relationship to other entities

------------------------------------------------
PART 6 – TECHNICAL & UX EXPECTATIONS
------------------------------------------------

- Design everything with a small local lunch bar in mind: low tech, minimal training.
- Prioritise:
  - Fewer clicks for staff.
  - Clear fonts and large buttons on iPad.
  - Very clear states: NEW, IN PROGRESS, READY, ISSUE, COMPLETED.
- If true “real-time” updates are not possible in this environment, simulate with:
  - Frequent polling, or
  - A “refresh orders” button for staff.

- Build the app so that in future it can be extended with:
  - Loyalty points or “order history” for repeat customers.
  - Saved favourite orders.

------------------------------------------------
PART 7 – YOUR TASK
------------------------------------------------

1) First, restate my goal in your own words to confirm understanding.
2) Then, design the data model with tables and fields.
3) Then, outline the key screens and user flows (Customer + Staff).
4) Finally, generate the actual app structure, screens, and logic within this platform as far as is technically possible.

If any feature (e.g. notifications, payment) cannot be fully implemented in this environment:
- Do NOT refuse.
- Instead, create the data structure and UI placeholders and explain how it would integrate with real payment/notification gateways in a production environment.

Make sure the end result is:
- Usable by real customers to place orders.
- Usable by sandwich staff on an iPad to manage orders and stock.
- Easy for the owner to maintain the menu and stock toggles.
