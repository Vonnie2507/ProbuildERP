## Database Schema
16 main entities:
- users, clients, leads, fenceStyles, products
- quotes, jobs, bom, productionTasks, installTasks
- scheduleEvents, payments, notifications, smsLogs, activityLogs, documents
- quoteFollowUps, automationCampaigns, campaignEnrollments

## API Endpoints
All endpoints use `/api/` prefix:
- GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE for CRUD operations
- Stripe payment integration via `/api/payments/:id/create-checkout`
- Dashboard stats: `/api/dashboard/stats`

## User Roles
7 distinct roles with role-based permissions:
- admin, sales, scheduler, production_manager, warehouse, installer, trade_client

## Key Features
1. **Lead Management**: Track leads from initial contact to conversion
2. **Quote Builder**: Generate quotes with trade pricing rules
3. **Job Workflow**: Full lifecycle from acceptance to completion
4. **Production Queue**: Track manufacturing stages
5. **Scheduling**: Calendar-based install/delivery scheduling
6. **Inventory**: Stock management with reorder alerts
7. **Payments**: Stripe integration, deposit/final payment tracking
8. **Installer App**: Mobile-friendly installer interface
9. **Trade Portal**: Self-service for trade clients

## Hierarchical Numbering System
The system uses a hierarchical numbering format that links leads, quotes, jobs, and invoices:
- **Leads (Opportunities)**: Auto-generated sequential numbers in format `PVC-XXX` (e.g., PVC-001, PVC-002)
- **Quotes**: Derived from lead number with quote sequence `PVC-XXX-Q#` (e.g., PVC-001-Q1, PVC-001-Q2)
- **Jobs**: Derived from lead number with `-JOB` suffix `PVC-XXX-JOB` (e.g., PVC-001-JOB)
- **Invoices**: One per job, derived from lead number with `-INV` suffix `PVC-XXX-INV` (e.g., PVC-001-INV)

Each lead can have multiple quotes, but only one job and one invoice per job. The numbering is auto-generated:
- `createLead()`: Generates next sequential lead number (PVC-001, PVC-002, etc.)
- `createQuote()`: Counts existing quotes for the lead and generates next sequence (Q1, Q2, etc.)
- `createJob()`: Generates job number and invoice number from the lead's number
